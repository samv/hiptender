ABOUT

This program is designed for running stand-ups.  Currently it only
handles a single stand-up/team.

INSTALLATION

Currently it's not very slick :-)

I'd recommend running it from the checkout:

  virtualenv env && . env/bin/activate
  python setup.py develop
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  pip install -e .

CONFIGURATION

First, copy the configuration files "hipchat.cfg.example" and
"local_settings.py.example" to their proper names:

  cp hipchat.cfg.example hipchat.cfg
  cp local_settings.py.example local_settings.py

Then, edit the files.  The hipchat.cfg needs to contain the API token
that you issued via the API, and it needs to be an admin token.  The
local_settings.py file contains the room names, schedule, and the name
of the bot for tailoring to your needs.

RUNNING

You should be able to run the bot using:

  hiptender

There is currently no command-line parsing.  Patches welcome!
